# My Music Collection

Back in the day I used to collect a lot of music.  
I just have all of them lying in my old laptop, and it's more than 350 GB of music.

I don't want all that taking up space in my new laptop, and I don't want to forget about the collection either. There's
so much in there that I don't get time to listen to anymore and so much that I've actually forgotten about.

Hence, I've decided to store just the names of the songs from my collection into this website.
